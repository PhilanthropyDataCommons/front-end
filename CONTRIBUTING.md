## Guidelines specific to this project

### Populating "Recent Changes"

If your change affects the user experience,
describe it in concise, non-technical language
in the `RECENT_CHANGES.md` document
under a heading for the current month.
Include this description in the PR
that contains your change.

Consult the existing document
for a sense of what sort of changes
justify inclusion in `RECENT_CHANGES.md`,
and for how to write a good description.

As a reviewer,
be sure to review `RECENT_CHANGES.md` additions as well â€”
and if the submitter didn't write one,
be sure to consider whether they should.
